# Enter the Track Shack!

Hey there musician! Have you got a track that's got great potential, but its missing a few things? Maybe a part from an instrument you can't play? ***take into the Track ShackÂ®!*** at the Track Shack, you can collaborate with musicians who play different instruments to produce one great track, combining all your talents.

### Background 

Track Shack is a social media applicaiton that is designed to create an environment that allows musicians to post their current projects and seek collaboration with musicians of other musical persuasions. We wanted to develop an application that allows musicians to more easily find the missing components they need when writting music. 


Ex: If a user plays a guitar and they are interested adding drums to it, then they could post an audio clip of the current piece and specificy that they are looking for someone to add drums to the audio file. Another user can then download that audio file, re-record it with their drum beat, and comment on the original post with their new audio file for the original poster to download!
